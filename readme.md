## 🌟System Overview

Our system introduces three key innovations for automated video processing. **Intent Analysis** captures both explicit and implicit sub-intents beyond user commands. **Autonamous Tool Use & Planning** employs graph-powered workflow generation with adaptive feedback loops for automated agent orchestration. **Multi-Modal Understanding** transforms raw input into semantically aligned visual queries for enhanced retrieval.

### 🧠 **Intent Analysis**
	
- 🔍 VideoAgent intelligently **decomposes user instructions** into both **explicit and implicit sub-intents**, capturing nuanced requirements that users may not explicitly state. This advanced parsing ensures **comprehensive understanding** of user goals beyond surface-level commands.

- 🎯 Through an **intent-to-agent mapping mechanism**, the system identifies precisely which capabilities within the multi-agent framework are needed. This targeted approach enables **efficient activation** of relevant system components while avoiding unnecessary computational overhead for **optimal task execution**.

### 🔧 **Autonomous Tool Use & Planning**

- ⚙️ **A graph-powered framework** automatically translates user intents into **executable workflows**. The system dynamically selects appropriate agents and constructs optimal execution sequences. Nodes represent tool capabilities while edges define workflow connections for complex video tasks.

- 🔄 Adaptive feedback loops continuously refine the planning process through **two-step self-evaluation**. This ensures robust **automated decision-making** and seamless execution. The system **self-corrects** and optimizes performance throughout the entire task lifecycle.

### 🎬 **Multi-Modal Understanding**

- 📋 **The Storyboard Agent** transforms raw user input into **optimized visual queries**. It first analyzes pre-captioned video material banks to understand available resources. This foundational analysis ensures the system knows exactly what content is accessible for query processing.

- 💡 The agent then **decomposes user input** into **fine-grained sub-queries** that are both visually and semantically aligned. This sophisticated breakdown enables **enhanced video retrieval** by matching user intentions with the most relevant visual content in the database.

## 🔧Evaluation
We conduct extensive experiments across multiple dimensions to validate the effectiveness of VideoAgent in addressing key challenges.

### Boundless Creativity via Workflow Construction

To evaluate VideoAgent's **boundless creativity** through automatic workflow construction, we compared five broadly applicable agents across three backbone models. Our findings demonstrate that VideoAgent significantly outperforms other baselines on the Audio and Video datasets, showcasing its **creative workflow generation capabilities** through graph-structured guidance and self-reflection driven by dedicated self-evaluation feedback. Furthermore, we observe that VideoAgent exhibits superior and more stable **creative performance** under the Claude 3.7 backbone compared to GPT-4o and Deepseek-v3, while other baseline methods show fluctuations across different backbones. This highlights VideoAgent's ability to **unleash boundless creativity** by automatically constructing diverse and effective workflows that adapt to various user requirements, with more capable LLMs achieving deeper comprehension and providing more robust creative solutions for complex graph-based tasks.

### Superior Multimodal Understanding

To validate our multimodal understanding capabilities, we conducted text-to-video retrieval experiments using shuffled caption queries. The evaluation employs three metrics to assess our model's ability to retrieve corresponding visual content: Recall measures the model's ability to correctly reorder shuffled video clips by comparing retrieved clip midpoints against ground truth positions; Embedding Matching-based score assesses coarse-grained alignment between generated videos and high-level caption summaries; and Intersection over Union quantifies temporal alignment accuracy at the clip level by computing the ratio of temporal overlap to total coverage between retrieved and ground truth intervals. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can retrieve more accurate video segments, thereby showcasing our precise multimodal understanding capabilities.

### More Iterations, Better Performance

We investigate VideoAgent's iterative refinement capabilities by analyzing the impact of reflection rounds on performance. Through comprehensive hyperparameter experiments on workflow composition across two datasets using three LLM backbones, we demonstrate VideoAgent's **notable self-improvement ability**. The results reveal that while early iterations produce baseline results, our system's **adaptive reflection mechanism** drives significant performance gains with each subsequent round. VideoAgent achieves **consistent workflow composition success rates of 0.95** across all tested configurations, showcasing its **robust self-correction capabilities** and **reliable high-quality output** regardless of the underlying LLM backbone.

# The console will output:
User Requirement: ...
# Requirement Example:
# 1. I need to create a reworded version of an existing video where the speech content is modified while maintaining the original speaker's voice. The video should have the same visuals as the original, but with updated dialogue that follows my specific requirements.
# 2. I have a standup comedy script that I'd like to turn into a professional-looking video. I need the script to be performed with good comedic timing and audience reactions, then matched with relevant video footage to create a complete standup comedy special. I already have a reference script and some footage I want to use for the video.
```
The current LLM selections are optimized for each function.

You can also adjust the model names in `VideoAgent\environment\config\llm.py` if needed.
